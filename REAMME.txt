Currently to run graphics you need to download java fx 
Then change file paths in launch.JSON and settings.json or download to same file path?
To run graphics make sure to run the Main.java in src.blackjackproject
Need to move main.java logic  -> Main.java in src

 - TODO maybe add all the required files into this project so you can download easily between computers?
